where ``\mathbf{e}(k)`` is an unknown zero mean white noise. The estimations does not use
``\mathbf{B_s}``, it is thus ignored. Note that this function is called twice :

1. for the unmodeled disturbances at measured outputs ``\mathbf{y^m}``, and
2. for the unmodeled disturbances at manipulated inputs ``\mathbf{u}``.
